## Learning Objectives
* Why C programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #cisfun :))
* Who invented C
* Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* What happens when you type ```gcc main.c```
* What is an entry point
* What is ```main```
* How to print text using ```printf```, ```puts``` and ```putchar```
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator ```sizeof```
* How to compile using ```gcc```
* What is the default program name when compiling with ```gcc```
* What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with ```betty-style```
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* How does the ```main``` function influence the return value of the program
